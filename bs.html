            deeply grateful to have your guidance on this.

            cannot thank you enough!

            mi scusi the scale of this document - it aims to serve (me) as some kind of mud map for the visual side of this endeavour. i hope it can serve <u>you</u> with some sprawling (and probably overwhelming) insight into things i like and the general direction of my compass.

    <h1>background & direction</h1>
    <br>

    before being faced with the employment drama there was never really any intention to be doing repairs, but the very slow realisation was that it could be a semi-stable income while studying, and hopefully afford us a little flexibility around soph's work and managing lucien.
    <br>
    <br>
    there is only a handful of techs left operating and they are all expensive and very, very busy. <a href="dave aurora">logitronics</a> and <a href="https://www.davidauroraaudio.com/">dave aurora</a> are the two 'go-to' northside techs - both are amazing at what they do but wait times are often in the vicinity of 3-12 months to even have your gear looked at, and if difficult or time-consuming customers will often be told (after waiting months) that they can't/won't do the repair. in some cases i've even heard of people leaving gear with techs under the premise of 'we're super busy but if you want to leave it with us, we'll try get to it when things quiet down'...
    <br><br>
    so the aim is to create something that is a bit more visible, approachable and honest. there is no intention to necessarily compete, or to take on work that is beyond my skill-set - but perhaps i can be more available to take on 'lesser' repairs, and people can have things working again, sooner.
    <br><br>
    <i>but...</i>
    <br><br>
    in parallel with repairs i will be pumping a lot of effort into building/designing things for sale, with the ultimate goal being to gradually fade repairs out and replace it with short production runs. this will begin with synth modules, and expand into studio and hi-fi gear. 
    <br><br>
    it has been my repeated experience that 'good' gear is prohibitively expensive, unnecessarily complicated or, at worst, with-held/gate-kept by people pedalling hype or elitist agendas... and most of it looks like fucking trash. but once you chip away at this exterior, there is an insane world of pragmatic, diy/open-source stuff (which also often looks like trash) set free by people who haven't forgotten that it's all about making and/or listening to music. the amount of knowledge i have consumed via these kind of resources is pretty mind-blowing - so the goal is to put a lot of that shared intel into practice and make it accessible (without insane price tags or years of experience), make it look good/alright/understated and make it to last.
    <br><br>
    i genuinely hope to keep the ethos behind open-source and <a href="https://permacomputing.net/">permacomputing</a> as a guiding light in all of this. the website will continue to be lightweight (purely html/css) with lots of relevant information/links/learning resources. the emphasis will always be doing things well, with longevity.

    <h1>goals/deliverables</h1>
    so, without burdening you with some kind of full-blown branding exercise, i would love to begin the process of developing the visual language of puff, with the most important outcomes being;
    <ul>
        <li>a non-type logo</li>
        <li>perhaps a word mark to accompany it - though open to there not being one (<i>or</i> one or the other)</li>    
        <li>a flyer - for putting up (a4?) and dropping off places (a5?)</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
        will follow beth's suggestion of just plastering flyers up everywhere, but will also drop details off at music and hifi shops. this is the extent of my 'promo' right now - so very open to suggestion.
        <br><br>
        looking to arrange for some stickers to be printed (maybe care area for bonus low-key social media promo). these can either be pure logo, or perhaps something a little more detailed if you were into it.
        <br><br>
        beyond these bits i truly don't want to consume too much of your time, or have this become too arduous a thing. that being said, i remain pretty pliable on how to play things and am more than open to discussing any and all ideas that may spring to mind.
        <br><br>
        in the past, through my own work, i have found it incredibly frustrating to be given carte blanche with very little input on direction, but understand everyone works <u>very</u> differently - so let me know how you like to play things. i'm equally happy to leave you to your devices as i am for there to be active discussion to & fro.
        <br><br>

    <h2>logo</h2>
    there is only a few things worth stressing here...
    <br>
    <li>i am incredibly cautious around using or adapting existing symbols used in audio/electronics. mostly due to potential misinterpretation and/or potentially unforeseen associations.</li>
    <li>definitely not fond of character/mascots.</li>
    <br><br>
    the most desired <i>wish</i> is that the logo, whether text or visual (or both), be able to withstand being (re)interpreted across various mediums or materials. definitely not something that is being redesigned each time it is used, but thinking forward especially to face-plates and enclosures for equipment there are some pretty shitty limitations when it comes to printing panel graphics.
    <br><br>
    there are definitely some amazing <a href="bs/IMG_0056.PNG">examples</a> of <a href="https://thebeast.co.uk/silkscreen/">

        how to do this well
    </a>
     - but there is sadly no one local (or even in the country) i've been able to find that can meet the desired quality, or who are even willing to take on smaller production run jobs.
    <br><br>
    fortunately that leaves the door open to more exciting things like 
    <a href="bs/IMG_0052.PNG">badges</a>, 
    <a href="bs/IMG_0054.PNG">laminated paper</a>, 
    <a href="bs/IMG_0050.PNG">engraving/embossing</a>,
     cnc milling (metal, 
     <a href="https://patch-point.com/collections/ciat-lonbarde">wood</a>, 
     <a href="bs/IMG_0051.jpg">plastic</a>) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydsASJZ_VpY?si=UdLKbdf1CMjJY37-">paint</a>. there is also some interesting ways of exploiting the way <a href="bs/IMG_0055.PNG">circuit boards</a> are made (<a href="https://youtu.be/73iBaIu2RTg?si=2_HHq5fpLB4MdmUJ&t=1464">lots of parallels to screen printing</a>). so a constant exploration of the logo via these mediums (in terms of physical application) is really important. 
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>type</h2>
    ideally be open-source.
    <br><br>
    for everything apart from a wordmark - i love and adore monospace type and am seeking consistency across web and print in this regard. the website currently uses noto, but pretty eager to find something that isn't made by google or ibm, even better if they are a local type designer.
    <br><br>
    the challenge (for me) is finding something that isn't just a single weight and has a bit of a fleshed out family. the chosen typeface will be used in everything - web, invoices, manuals, technical drawings, etc etc.
    <br><br>
    as discussed, more than happy to roll with a dual typeface approach if it's the right fit. might even be the <i>right</i> approach to take considering the depth of documentation it needs to be used across. i guess the firm points are;<br>
    <ul>
        <li>open-source/system fonts - local designers is a huge win</li>
        <li>print and web friendly</li>
        <li>no 'variable' type families - lose my fkn mind trying to make right of this stuff (unless it's something we work into a style-guide to give me rules to follow)
        </li>
    </ul>

                i have a long, and probably unhealthy infatuation with <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/6785-ECM-Records?page=1">ecm records</a> that started long before getting really into (euro) jazz. i think i came across abercrombie's <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHsZ_-9442o">timeless</a> when i was in high school - a tune that truly still gives me goosebumps. the cover is a 10/10 too. 
                <br><br>
                intimidating catalogue to dive into, but i think it's a life-long relationship kind of thing. <i>so</i> many earth shattering records buried in there for me. <a href="https://www.nts.live/shows/early-bird-show-jack-rollo/episodes/early-bird-show-jack-rollo-13th-may-2022">rollo early bird special</a> is great toe-dip listening. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6314fLleNo">surman</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wftjgLr4Yds&t">rypdal</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/19z4ZpKXZ0w?si=HDZLeThBLu3JUOU3">azimuth</a>...  both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UwyyZ3dkKE">hassell</a> records on ecm are insane... <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/540585-Codona">codona(!)</a>... lately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvo_P%C3%A4rt">arvo part</a> and always <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/169989-Eberhard-Weber">eberhard weber</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                over time the visual side of things became very honed, mostly driven by photography, but i have continually returned to the aesthetic of the earlier catalogue. there is a free/exciting/playful element that i love that was mostly due to the mind/hand of <a href="https://theartofcoverart.substack.com/p/the-designer-behind-the-visual-identity">barbara wojrisch</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="bs/ecmcovers.pdf">sleeves of desire</a> was published mid 90's and compiles a lot of that earlier design work - it's now crazy/rare and <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9783906700854?cm_sp=bdp-_-ISBN10-_-PLP">expensive</a>, but hopefully the <a href="bs/ecmcovers.pdf">pdf</a> is enough of a portal for you to get down on.
